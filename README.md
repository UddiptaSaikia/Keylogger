# Simple Keylogger in Python

This repository contains a simple Python keylogger that captures keystrokes and stores them in a text file. It's intended for learning about keylogging techniques and security awareness.

# Note
This project is for educational and ethical testing purposes only. Using keyloggers without explicit consent is illegal and unethical. Do not use this software for malicious purposes. I have used this video from youtube for reference : https://youtu.be/eLLFi5isqMc?si=7OvkVJyzG1xHsJMa

# Features
- Captures all keystrokes, including special keys (backspace, space, Enter, etc.)
- Stores keystrokes in a timestamped text file
- Uses the pynput library for keyboard input handling

# Requirements
- Python 
- pynput library: pip install pynput
# Usage
1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/UddiptaSaikia/Keylogger
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd Keylogger
3. Run the keylogger script: python Keylogger.pyw (The .pyw extension prevents a console window from opening)
4. The keylogger will start running in the background, capturing keystrokes.
5. To stop the keylogger, open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) and end the Python process.
# Keypoints
- The captured keystrokes are stored in the log.txt file within the project directory.
- The keylogger does not currently have any stealth features or persistence mechanisms.
- For educational purposes, you can explore adding features like: Encryption of log files, Emailing logs, Hiding the keylogger process
