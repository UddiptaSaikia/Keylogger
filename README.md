Simple Keylogger in Python
NOTE: This project is for educational and ethical testing purposes only. Using keyloggers without explicit consent is illegal and unethical. Do not use this software for malicious purposes.

Description
This repository contains a simple Python keylogger that captures keystrokes and stores them in a text file. It's intended for learning about keylogging techniques and security awareness.

Features
Captures all keystrokes, including special keys (backspace, space, Enter, etc.)
Stores keystrokes in a timestamped text file
Uses the pynput library for keyboard input handling
Requirements
Python 3.x
pynput library: pip install pynput
Usage
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-keylogger
Navigate to the project directory: cd simple-keylogger
Run the keylogger script: python keylogger.pyw (The .pyw extension prevents a console window from opening)
The keylogger will start running in the background, capturing keystrokes.
To stop the keylogger, open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) and end the Python process.
Key Points
The captured keystrokes are stored in the key_log.txt file within the project directory.
The keylogger does not currently have any stealth features or persistence mechanisms.
For educational purposes, you can explore adding features like:
Encryption of log files
Emailing logs
Hiding the keylogger process
Ethical Considerations
Always use keyloggers with explicit consent and for legitimate purposes.
Respect user privacy and data security.
Understand the legal implications of using keyloggers.
